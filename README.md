# Slidmk

Create presentations from a very simple file format
with styles and templates for the slides specified in hjson.

# Motivation

Big applications like Libreoffice/Powerpoint are complex and
hard to use; the myriad of options are distracting.
Similar apps (like Latex Beamer) don't let you customize the 
presentation as much as I would like to, so I took it into my own hands.
