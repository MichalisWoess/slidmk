# Slidmk

Create presentations from a very simple file format
with styles and templates for the slides specified in hjson

# Why

Big applications like Libreoffice/Powerpoint are pretty complex,
hard to use and distracting with all those options.
Similar apps (latex beamer, ...) don't let you customize the resulting
presentation as much as I would like, so i took into my own hands.
